Modular and Class-Based Design

The project is divided into small modules so things stay organized and easy to work with.
Most of the important parts are written using classes, which makes the code cleaner and easier to extend later.

1. Database Layer
I have kept all MongoDB-related work inside separate classes:

MasterDB – handles storing and fetching organization details.

OrganizationDB – manages data for each organization in its own collection.

This way, database code doesn’t mix with the API code.

2. Authentication Layer
JWT creation and verification is handled by a separate class.
This keeps all auth-related logic in one place.

3. Service Layer
The main business logic like creating an organization, updating it, or deleting it is written inside service classes.
The API routes simply call these functions instead of writing logic directly inside the routes.

4. API Layer
The API layer only contains the endpoints.
Each endpoint passes the request to the correct service class, which makes the routes clean and simple.

Overall, separating things like this makes the project easier to read and maintain.
If any new feature needs to be added later, it can be done without disturbing the other parts.
